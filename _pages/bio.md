[Chao Yu](https://chaovincentyu.com) (<a href="https://twitter.com/ChaoYuVincent">@ChaoYuVincent</a>) is interested in individual motivations and their impacts on collective behaviors, especially in online communities. I am particularly interested in how inconspicuous individual motives can lead to unintended behaviors when aggregated, and the collective “tipping” processes that are involved in these consequences. I use a wide variety of quantitative methods such as quasi-experiment, survival analysis, topic modeling, and agent-based modeling in my work. 

My past work has applied this micro-to-macro approach in several different communication scenarios. Please check my <a href="../portfolio/" > projects</a> under review for details. Manuscripts available upon request. 

I earned my bachelor's degree in Journalism from Peking University in China. I also studied in the Chinese University of Hong Kong for a semester as an exchange student, and worked as a summer journalist intern at Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) in Hong Kong.
