Welcome to my personal website! 

I study individual motivations and their impacts on collective behaviors, especially in online communities. I am particularly interested in how inconspicuous individual motives can lead to unintended behaviors when aggregated, and the collective “tipping” processes that are involved in these consequences. I use a wide variety of quantitative methods such as quasi-experiment, survival analysis, topic modeling, and agent-based modeling in my work.
