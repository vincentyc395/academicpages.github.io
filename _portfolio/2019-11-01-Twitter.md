title: "Tweeting about Climate: Which Politicians Speak up and What do They Speak up about?"
---

This study examines tweets (N= 1,103,119) sent by 638 US politicians regarding climate change (N= 10,135). Politicians are compared based on their constituents’ concerns about climate change, the objective risk their constituencies face from climate change, and their office levels (federal, state, local). Results reveal that federal Democrats from concerned and wealthier districts are most vocal about climate change. Objective risk was not associated with speaking about the topic. Analysis of the tweets shows the politicians’ unequal engagement leads to over-representations of some topics (e.g., “calls for action”), and under-representations of other topics (e.g., criticizing fossil fuels & deniers).
